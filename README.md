This Application takes an equation written in a text file such as 2312233234+84739293
and returns a result. Currently in version 1.0 all that it supports is addition
of 2 positive numbers, however support for negative numbers and multiplication will
likely be done in a later version. Remember to keep it in a good format or otherwise the application will crash
To compile on a unix system type "gcc -o inf InfiniteInteger.c" then type "./inf" to run
